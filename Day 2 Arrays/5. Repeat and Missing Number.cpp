5. Repeat and Missing Number

1. XOR all the elements in given array -> x 
2. take XOR of x ^ with (1^2^3^4...^N)
3. you will get x ^ y = num
4. separate the elements in two buckets with the help of left most set bit of num  
5. separate (1^2^3^4...^N) in two buckets 
6. XOR two buckets to get the missing and repeating number
